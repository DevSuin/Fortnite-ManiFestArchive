# Fortnite Manifest Archive
Manifests can be used for downloading diffrent versions of Fortnite.

**NOTE:Some builds can take up a lot of space so i recommend compressing them with https://github.com/Freaky/Compactor**

# How can i help?
If you ever used Manifests, there's a chance you have them somewhere on your drive. You can Send them to me on Discord (Kyiro#4383) or make a PR. I'd appriceate it
